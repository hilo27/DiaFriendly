Hello folks! This my first project "Hello World"-like, where i was tryng to write useful porgramm.

Its started with a request from my girl, she has diabetes, because of it she need make notes. The main problem is the speed of creating, she must write somewhere (and not lost it/forget where) what's time is it now, what she eat, and do some calculation (its further 'to-do' in this app).

Key aspect its speed, without unnecessary actions. As writing a program, list of 'TO-Do' updates and increases)))
